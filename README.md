# Movie Recommendation System  

## Overview  
The **Movie Recommendation System** is a personalized movie suggestion engine that utilizes machine learning techniques to recommend movies to users based on their preferences. The system integrates various methods, including data preprocessing, feature extraction, and similarity analysis, to provide accurate recommendations. By leveraging **cosine similarity** for movie comparison and incorporating **stemming** for text normalization, it ensures that recommendations align with user interests. The project culminates in an interactive web application built using **Streamlit**, allowing users to easily input their preferences and receive tailored movie suggestions.

## Steps Involved  

1. **Data Collection**  
   - Gathered movie data, including titles, genres, cast, and plot summaries.  

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Cleaned and formatted the data for consistent processing.  

3. **Feature Extraction**  
   - Used **stemming** and **vectorization** (Bag-of-words) to extract meaningful features from text data.  

4. **Similarity Computation**  
   - Calculated movie similarities using **cosine similarity**.  

5. **Frontend Development**  
   - Built an interactive user interface using **Streamlit** to provide movie recommendations seamlessly.  

## Tech Stack  
- **Python**: Core development.  
- **Libraries**: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, NLTK, Streamlit.
