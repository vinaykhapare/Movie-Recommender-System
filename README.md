# Movie Recommendation System

## Overview  
The **Movie Recommendation System** is a personalized engine that suggests movies to users based on their preferences. The system leverages machine learning techniques to analyze movie data and provide tailored recommendations. It incorporates methods such as **cosine similarity** for movie comparison and **stemming** for text normalization to ensure that suggestions align with user interests. The project culminates in an interactive web application built using **Streamlit**, enabling users to input their preferences and receive personalized movie recommendations.

## Steps Involved  

### 1. Data Collection  
- Gathered movie data, including titles, genres, cast, and plot summaries.

### 2. Data Preprocessing  
- Cleaned and formatted the data to ensure consistency in processing.

### 3. Feature Extraction  
- Used **stemming** and **vectorization** (Bag-of-words) techniques to extract meaningful features from the text data.

### 4. Similarity Computation  
- Calculated movie similarities using **cosine similarity** to recommend similar movies.

### 5. Frontend Development  
- Developed an interactive user interface with **Streamlit**, providing a seamless experience for users to input their preferences and receive movie suggestions.

## Tech Stack  
- **Python**: Main programming language.
- **Libraries**:  
  - **NumPy**: For numerical operations.  
  - **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.  
  - **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms and cosine similarity computation.  
  - **NLTK**: For natural language processing and stemming.  
  - **Streamlit**: For building the interactive frontend application.
